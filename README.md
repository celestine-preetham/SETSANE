<b>abundance_NPinternet.nb</b> (for XOR functionality among interesting wiring configurations, using Monte-Carlo and Mean-field methods).
Parameters that are recommended to be modified are:
    Np (number of particles per cluster)
    rP (radius of nanoparticle)
    rT (tunnelling length)
    nT (tunnelling number)
    uBG (background charge variance)
    
<b>digit_recognition.wl</b> (with abundance for random network, linear network, nonlinear network).
